//The slow but theoretical function:
/*
fun fib: i32 n -> i32
    if n <= 2 then 1
    else fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

/*
The function above should hopefully be compiled into something
resembling the following function.  To do this, the main 
transformation is the transformation of fib(n-1) into 
fib(n-3) + x1 where x1 is the result of the previous fib(n-2)
operation.  In order to do this, the compiler must know that
the function is pure in that it would obtain the same result
every time it is called with a given input.
