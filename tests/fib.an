        fib.an
    Compile and test an example fibbonacci function where the 
    code closely reflects the mathematical definition of the function,
    and is slow as a result.
`

~n:      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
~fib(n): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

~The slow but theoretical function:
`
fun fib: i32 n => i32
    if n <= 2 -> return 1
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
`

`
The function above should hopefully be compiled into something
resembling the following function.  To do this, the main 
transformation is the transformation of fib(n-1) into 
fib(n-3) + x1 where x1 is the result of the previous fib(n-2)
operation.  In order to do this, the compiler must know that
the function is pure in that it would obtain the same result
every time it is called with a given input.
`

fun fib: i32 n => i32
    if n <= 3 -> return (n+1)/2

    i32 x1 = fib(n-2)
    i32 x2 = x1 + fib(n-3)
    return x1 + x2
