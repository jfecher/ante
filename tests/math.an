    Tests declaration of basic functions with multiple parameters,
    as well as some basic binary operators.

~explicit list of parameters
fun add: i32 a, i32 b => i32
    return a + b

~shorthand parameter list
fun mul: i32 a b => i32
    return a * b


let n1 = 3
let n2 = 4

printf "%d + %d = %d\n" n1 n2 (add n1 n2)
printf "%d * %d = %d\n" n1 n2 (mul n1 n2)

~Void values can be used in expressions if they are followed by
~the sequencing operator ;

~print out 5 and set n3 to 5
let n3 = print 5; 5
