//! This module is the home for any vastly unsafe function.
//! This module should only be used as a last resort.
//!
//! Currently, these functions are only used when retrieving the
//! definition of variables from the cache to separate the mutability/lifetime
//! of the definition from that of the cache. These should be able
//! to be removed if the AST nodes ever become arena allocated and
//! a key can be used from the arena instead of a direct reference in the ModuleCache.
